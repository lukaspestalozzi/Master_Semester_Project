% TODO write nicer, especially "with carefully crafted algorithms and heuristics"
Tichu is a multiplayer card game with hidden information and both cooperative and competitive elements.
Those properties makes it an interesting game from the point of view of Artificial Intelligence. In \cite{david12}, David Pfander shows that it is possible to create an agent that is able to compete with an average human player. However, his approach relies on carefully crafted heuristics based on specific "expert" knowledge about the tactics of the game.
This project explores ... without expert knowledge / general approach easy applicable to other similar games ... concentrate on how to deal with hidden information and big game tree ...

% TODO results
Results, knowing other hands is advanageous ... it is possible to a certain degree to learn from data of previous played games (human player games) ... computational budged is a problem ... "semi expert" knowledge helps ...
